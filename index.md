## Welcome to my Github IO

# Introduction:
Hey everyone, my name is Biki and I am currently a Freshman studying Software Engineering at RIT! I was born in India, however I grew up in Hartford, Vermont. I went to school at Hartford High and during my time in school, I took a particular interest in Software Engineering and programming. My parents own a takeout food business and I usually work there during the school year or over the summer. When I'm not working I like to socialize, play video games, and play tennis. 
### My Favourite Food

### What I hope to learn while in SWEN 101:
- How the development process works as a whole
- How to work better with other group mates
- What a professional work environment would demand
- What kinda skills would the job demand
