# Introduction:
Hey everyone, my name is Biki and I am currently a Freshman studying Software Engineering at RIT! I was born in India, however I grew up in Hartford, Vermont. I went to school at Hartford High and during my time in school, I took a particular interest in Software Engineering and programming. My parents own a takeout food business and I usually work there during the school year or over the summer. When I'm not working I like to socialize, play video games, and play tennis.
